-lombok not working - to create constructor,getter and setters
-in postman -> when returning saved data when signup - null is stored in
    username(null) - check it. we are not setting username so it stores null.
    we dont store username field in database bcoz email==username.

    password(null) - password is correctly returned from save() . check encoder is working or not.
